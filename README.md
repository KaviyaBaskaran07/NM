ðŸ§  Project Description: Emotion-Aware Customer Service Chatbot

A next-generation AI-powered customer service chatbot that detects implicit emotional cues like disappointment or frustration (e.g., "I was hoping for something better") and adapts its responses accordingly. The goal is to improve customer satisfaction, reduce churn, and create a more human-like support experience.


âœ… Key Requirements
1. Emotion & Sentiment Classification

    Detect explicit and implicit emotional tones (e.g., anger, disappointment, confusion).

    Multi-label classification model with high precision in low-context, subtle expressions.

2. Contextual Understanding

    Maintain dialogue history and context awareness.

    Handle ambiguous or emotionally indirect phrases using NLP and conversational memory.

3. Empathetic Response Generation

    Generate emotionally intelligent responses that align with detected sentiments.

    Ensure brand-aligned tone (apologetic, supportive, informative, etc.).

4. Reinforcement Learning & Feedback Loop

    Use feedback signals (CSAT, sentiment shift, resolution outcome) to optimize dialogue strategy.

    Incorporate human-in-the-loop for fine-tuning responses and reward modeling.

5. Scalability & Integration

    Deployable via chat widgets, mobile apps, or third-party CRM platforms.

    Scalable to handle thousands of concurrent users.
